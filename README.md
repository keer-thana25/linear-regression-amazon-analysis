# Amazon Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a complete Machine Learning pipeline using Amazon product data. 

The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and performance metrics calculation using Linear Regression.

## 🛠 Tasks Performed

### ✅ Task 1: Brand Column Encoding
- Converted the categorical `Brand` column into numerical format using **One Hot Encoding**.

### ✅ Task 2: Adding Encoded Features
- Added the newly created `brand_encoded` columns into the main dataframe.

### ✅ Task 3: Data Type Conversion
- Converted all brand encoded columns into integer format for model compatibility.

### ✅ Task 4: Feature & Target Separation
- Divided the dataset into:
  - **X (Independent Variables)**
  - **y (Dependent Variable - Price)**

### ✅ Task 5: Train-Test Split
- Split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()`.

### ✅ Task 6: Model Training
- Initialized the Linear Regression model
- Loaded and trained the model
- Fitted the model with training data
- Predicted results using test data

### ✅ Task 7: Error Metrics Calculation
- Calculated:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

### ✅ Task 8: Model Performance
- Calculated R² Score to evaluate model accuracy.
